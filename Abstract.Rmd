  This study aimed to predict departure delay from 2008 to 2016 against time assessing factors like year, carrier, air time, distance, week and season. Additionally this work provided an expository review of modern deep learning techniques like the H2O platform, which was used to perform modeling techniques like logistic regression and neural networks in R. Three different models were performed. A simple logistic regression was used to predict departure delay over 30 minutes against year, carrier, air time, distance, week and season. A subsequent simple logistic regression model was built to study influence of weather on predicting departure delay occurrence over 30 minutes against season, month, week, weekend, day, hour, distance and air time. Weather predictors included temperature, dewpoint, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, wind gust, precipitation, pressure and visibility. Lastly a deep learning neural network was built to study the influence of variables like year, month, carrier, distance, hour, week, weekend and season on predicting departure delay over 90 minutes. Additionally grid, random search and checkpoint variations of the original models were developed to facilitate hyperparameter specification.

  Overall, carrier type, season, distance and air time were most important at predicting departure delay occurrence over 30 minutes using logistic regression. Weather was not very important in predicting departure delay occurrence over 30 minutes. Hour (5, 6 and 9 am) and carrier status (Hawaiian Airlines, Northwest, Skywest and US Airlines) were most important at predicting departure delay over 90 minutes in the deep learning model.
